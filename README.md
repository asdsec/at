# AT Command Line Tool

AT is a command line tool designed specifically for use within 42 schools. It streamlines header checks, initially focusing on username validation within headers. This utility aims to simplify and enhance the validation processes tailored for 42 Echole students.

## Getting Started

### Usage

Example:

```bash
at check header <your_username>
```

### Future Updates

This tool is continuously evolving to provide more functionalities, all focused on aiding 42 Echole users. Stay tuned for forthcoming updates:

- `at header add . --username <your_username> --email <your_email>`
  
  Appends your header to all `.c` and `.h` files.

- There will be an config mangement system, so `--username` and `--email` flasgs will be optional.
